## Running the generator and visualizer

The following information shows the necessary commands to create a mesh and visualize the mesh in an SVG file. If needed, the mesh can be visualized in debug mode by including a `-X` flag.

Running the commands with no extra arguments will result in a grid mesh composed of squares, where the canvas size is 500x500 with a square size of 20. 

When running the generator, the following arguments can be used to control the mesh generation:

```
java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t <mesh type> -d <canvas height> -w <canvas width> -s <square size> -n <number of polygons> -r <relaxation level>
```

To see all possible user configurations, run the above with argument ```-h``` or ```--help```

The following is an example of generating and visualizing a **regular** mesh:

```mvn install```

```java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t regular -d 600 -w 600 -s 15```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar generator/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg```

The following is an example of generating and visualizing an **irregular** mesh:

```mvn install```

```java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t irregular -n 300 -r 3```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar generator/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg```

## Generating islands

The following information shows how to transform an existing mesh by generating terrain.

When running the island generator, the following arguments can be used to control the island generation:

```
java -jar island/island.jar -i <mesh input path> -o <mesh output path> --mode <generation mode> --shape <island shape> --altitude <altitude profile> --lakes <max number of lakes> --rivers <number of rivers>
```

To see all possible user configurations, run the above with argument ```-h``` or ```--help```

Pre-made shapes that can be used:  
```--shape circle, --shape ellipse, --shape rectangle, --shape square```

Pre-made altitude profiles that can be used:  
```--altitude centralPeak, --shape cornerPeaks, --shape randomPeaks```

The following is an example of generating and visualizing an island mesh:

```mvn install```

```java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t irregular -d 1000 -w 1000 -n 2000```

```java -jar island/island.jar -i generator/sample.mesh -o island/sample.mesh --mode lagoon```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar island/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg```

The following is an example of generating and visualizing an ellipse shaped island with four mountains on the edges mesh:
```mvn install```

```java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t irregular -d 1000 -w 1000 -n 2000```

```java -jar island/island.jar -i generator/sample.mesh -o island/sample.mesh --shape ellipse --altitude cornerMountains```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar island/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg```

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog

### Definition of Done

If a feature works as intended without bugs and the code is clean and concise, it is considered done.
