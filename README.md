## How to run the product

The following information shows the necessary commands to create a mesh and visualize the mesh in an SVG file. If needed, the mesh can be visualized in debug mode by including a `-X` flag.

Running the commands with no extra arguments will result in a grid mesh composed of squares, where the canvas size is 500x500 with a square size of 20. 

When running the generator, the following arguments can be used to control the mesh generation:

```
java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t <mesh type> -d <canvas height> -w <canvas width> -s <square size> -n <number of polygons> -r <relaxation level>
```

To see all possible user configurations, run the above with argument ```-h``` or ```--help```

The following is an example of generating and visualizing a **regular** mesh:

```mvn install```

```java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t regular -d 600 -w 600 -s 15```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar generator/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar generator/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg -X```

The following is an example of generating and visualizing an **irregular** mesh:

```mvn install```

```java -jar generator/generator.jar generator/sample.mesh -t irregular -n 300 -r 3```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar generator/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg```

```java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar generator/sample.mesh visualizer/sample.svg -X```

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
cd generator 
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
cd visualizer 
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tools like `rsvg-convert`


### Visualizer in debug mode
To visualize an existing mesh in debug mode, where it shows polygons in black, centroids in red, and neighbourhood relationships in light grey, simply add '-X' as the third argument when running the visualizer.
```
cd visualizer 
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
```

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog

### Definition of Done

If a feature works as intended without bugs and the code is clean and concise, it is considered done.
