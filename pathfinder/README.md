## Explanation

The pathfinder library consists of a Graph ADT that contains nodes and edges connecting those nodes. Nodes on the graph may represent any given structure, as attributes can be created without limit. 

The base graph library has been extending by implementing a way to find paths between nodes. One can get the single-source shortest path from a given source node to any other node. Furthermore, one can find a path between two given nodes, where a list of nodes representing the path will be returned. 

This library can be further extended by implementing more path-finding problems, such as finding the longest path between two nodes.
